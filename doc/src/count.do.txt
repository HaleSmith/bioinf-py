label{bioinf:basics}

We start with some very simple examples on DNA analysis that bring together
basic building blocks in programming: loops, `if` tests, and functions.

===== Counting Letters in DNA Strings =====
label{bioinf:count}

Given some string `dna` containing the letters A, C, G, or T,
representing the bases that make up DNA, we ask the question: how
many times does a certain base occur in the DNA string?
For example, if `dna` is ATGGCATTA and we ask how many times the
base A occur in this string, the answer is 3.

A general Python implementation answering this problem can be done
in many ways. Several possible solutions are presented below.

=== List Iteration ===

idx{list iteration}

The most straightforward solution is to loop over the letters
in the string, test if the current letter equals the desired one,
and if so, increase a counter. Looping over the letters is
obvious if the letters are stored in a list. This is easily
done by converting a string to a list:
!bc pyshell
>>> list('ATGC')
['A', 'T', 'G', 'C']
!ec
Our first solution becomes

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v1\(@def count_v2\(dna

=== String Iteration ===

idx{string iteration}

Python allows us to iterate directly over a string without converting
it to a list:
!bc pyshell
>>> for c in 'ATGC':
...     print c
A
T
G
C
!ec
In fact, all built-in objects in Python that contain a set of elements in
a particular sequence allow a `for` loop construction of the
type `for element in object`.
#Examples of such objects are
#lists, tuples, strings, arrays, files, dictionaries

A slight improvement of our solution is therefore to iterate directly
over the string:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v2\(dna@def count_v2_demo

We have here illustrated two alternative ways of writing out text
where the value of variables are to be inserted in ``slots'' in the
string.

=== Program Flow ===

It is fundamental for correct programming to understand how
to simulate a program by hand, statement by
statement. Three tools are
effective for helping you reach the required understanding of performing
a simulation by hand:

 o printing variables and messages,
 o using a debugger,
 o using the "Online Python Tutor": "http://www.pythontutor.com/".

Inserting `print` statements and examining the variables is the
simplest approach to investigating
what is going on:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v2_demo@def count_v3

idx{using a debugger}

# Note: do not use !bc pyshell for debugging sessions since
# sphinx treats ipy as interactive sessions and therefore
# drops any environment (it is automatically handled)

An efficient way to explore this program is to run it in a
debugger where we can step through each statement and see what
is printed out. Start `ipython` in a terminal window and run the
program "`count_v2_demo.py`": "${src_path}/count_v2_demo.py" with
a debugger: `run -d count_v2_demo.py`. Use `s` (for step) to
step through each statement, or `n` (for next) for proceeding to the
next statement without stepping through a function that is called.
!bc cod
ipdb> s
> /some/disk/user/bioinf/src/count_v2_demo.py(2)count_v2_demo()
1     1 def count_v1_demo(dna, base):
----> 2     print 'dna:', dna
      3     print 'base:', base

ipdb> s
dna: ATGCGGACCTAT
> /some/disk/user/bioinf/src/count_v2_demo.py(3)count_v2_demo()
      2     print 'dna:', dna
----> 3     print 'base:', base
      4     i = 0 # counter
!ec
Observe the output of the `print` statements. One can also
print a variable explicitly inside the debugger:
!bc cod
ipdb> print base
C
!ec

idx{Online Python Tutor}

The "Online Python Tutor": "http://www.pythontutor.com/"
is, at least for small programs, a splendid alternative to
debuggers. Go to the web page, erase the sample code and paste in your
own code. Press *Visual execution*, then *Forward* to execute
statements one by one. The status of variables are
explained to the right, and the text field below the program shows the output
from `print` statements.  An example is shown in Figure ref{bioinf:fig:pot}.

Misunderstanding of the program flow is one of the most frequent
sources of programming errors, so whenever in doubt about any program
flow, use one of the three mentioned techniques to establish
confidence!

% endif

=== Index Iteration ===

Although it is natural in Python to iterate over the letters in a
string (or more generally over elements in a sequence), programmers
with experience from other languages (Fortran, C and Java are
examples) are used to `for` loops with an integer counter running over
all indices in a string or array:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v3@def count_v4

Python indices always start at 0 so the legal indices for our
string become `0`, `1`, ...,
`len(dna)-1`, where `len(dna)` is the number of letters in the
string `dna`. The `range(x)` function returns a list of integers
`0`, `1`, ..., `x-1`, implying that `range(len(dna))` generates
all the legal indices for `dna`.

=== While Loops ===

The `while` loop equivalent to the last function reads

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v4@def count_v5

Correct indentation is here crucial: a typical error is to fail
indenting the `j += 1` line correctly.

=== Summing a Boolean List ===

The idea now is to create a list `m` where `m[i]` is `True` if
`dna[i]` equals the letter we search for (`base`).
The number of `True` values in `m` is then the number of `base`
letters in `dna`. We can use the `sum` function to find
this number because doing arithmetics with boolean lists
automatically interprets `True` as `1` and `False` as `0`.
That is, `sum(m)` returns the number of `True` elements in `m`.
A possible function doing this is

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v5@def count_v6

=== Inline If Test ===

Shorter, more compact code is often a goal if the compactness
enhances readability. The four-line `if` test in the previous
function can be condensed to one line using the inline
`if` construction: `if condition value1 else value2`.

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v6@def count_v7

=== Using Boolean Values Directly ===

The inline `if` test is in fact redundant in the previous function
because the value of the condition `c == base` can be used
directly: it has the value `True` or `False`. This saves
some typing and adds clarity, at least to Python programmers with
some experience:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v7@def count_v8


=== List Comprehensions ===

idx{list comprehension} idx{`sum`}

Building a list with the aid of a `for` loop can often be condensed to
a single line by using list comprehensions: `[expr for e in
sequence]`, where `expr` is some expression normally involving the
iteration variable `e`. In our last example, we can introduce a list
comprehension

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v8@def count_v9

Here it is tempting to get rid of the `m` variable and
reduce the function body to a single line:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v9@def count_v10

=== Using a Sum Iterator ===

idx{`sum` iterator}

The DNA string is usually huge - 3 billion letters for the human
species. Making a boolean array with `True` and `False` values
therefore increases the memory usage by a factor of two
in our sample functions `count_v5` to `count_v9`.
Summing without actually storing an extra list is desirable.
Fortunately, `sum([x for x in s])` can be replaced by
`sum(x for x in s)`, where the latter sums the elements in `s`
as `x` visits the elements of `s` one by one. Removing the brackets
therefore avoids first making a list before applying `sum` to
that list. This is a minor modification of the `count_v9` function:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v10@def count_v11

Below we shall measure the impact of the various program constructs
on the CPU time.

=== Extracting Indices ===

Instead of making a boolean list with elements expressing whether
a letter matches the given `base` or not, we may collect all
the indices of the matches. This can be done by adding an `if`
test to the list comprehension:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v11@def count_v12

The "Online Python Tutor": "http://www.pythontutor.com/" is
really helpful to reach an understanding of this compact code.
Alternatively, you may play with the constructions in an
interactive Python shell:

!bc pyshell
>>> dna = 'AATGCTTA'
>>> base = 'A'
>>> indices = [i for i in range(len(dna)) if dna[i] == base]
>>> indices
[0, 1, 7]
>>> print dna[0], dna[1], dna[7]  # check
A A A
!ec
Observe that the element `i` in the list comprehension is only
made for those `i`
where `dna[i] == base`.

=== Using Python's Library ===

Very often when you set out to do a task in Python, there is already
functionality for the task in the object itself, in the Python
libraries, or in third-party libraries found on the Internet.
Counting how many times a letter (or substring) `base` appears in a
string `dna` is obviously a very common task so Python supports
it by the syntax `dna.count(base)`:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v12@import random


===== Efficiency Assessment =====
label{bioinf:count:cpu}

Now we have 11 different versions of how to count the occurrences
of a letter in a string. Which one of these implementations is the fastest?
To answer the question we need some test data, which should be a
huge string `dna`.

=== Generating Random DNA Strings ===

idx{random strings}

The simplest way of generating a long string is to repeat a
character a large number of times:
!bc pycod
N = 1000000
dna = 'A'*N
!ec
The resulting string is just `'AAA...A`, of length `N`, which is fine
for testing the efficiency of Python functions. Nevertheless, it is
more exciting to work with a DNA string with letters from the whole
alphabet A, C, G, and T. To make a DNA string with a random
composition of the letters we can first make a list of random
letters and then join all those letters to a string:
!bc pycod
import random
alphabet = list('ATGC')
dna = [random.choice(alphabet) for i in range(N)]
dna = ''.join(dna)  # join the list elements to a string
!ec
The `random.choice(x)` function selects an element in the list
`x` at random.

Note that `N` is very often a large number. In Python version 2.x,
`range(N)` generates a list of `N` integers. We can avoid the list by
using `xrange` which generates an integer at a time and not the whole
list. In Python version 3.x, the `range` function is actually the
`xrange` function in version 2.x.  Using `xrange`, combining the
statements, and wrapping the construction of a random DNA string in a
function, gives

!bc pycod
import random

def generate_string(N, alphabet='ACGT'):
    return ''.join([random.choice(alphabet) for i in xrange(N)])

dna = generate_string(600000)
!ec
The call `generate_string(10)` may generate something like `AATGGCAGAA`.

=== Measuring CPU Time ===

idx{CPU time measurements}

Our next goal is to see how much time the various `count_v*`
functions spend on counting letters in a huge string, which is to be
generated as shown above.
Measuring the time spent in a program can be done by the `time`
module:
!bc pycod
import time
...
t0 = time.clock()
# do stuff
t1 = time.clock()
cpu_time = t1 - t0
!ec
The `time.clock()` function returns the CPU time spent in the program since
its start. If the interest is in the total time, also including reading
and writing files, `time.time()` is the appropriate function to call.

Running through all our functions made so far and recording timings can be
done by

!bc pycod
import time
functions = [count_v1, count_v2, count_v3, count_v4,
             count_v5, count_v6, count_v7, count_v8,
             count_v9, count_v10, count_v11, count_v12]
timings = []  # timings[i] holds CPU time for functions[i]

for function in functions:
    t0 = time.clock()
    function(dna, 'A')
    t1 = time.clock()
    cpu_time = t1 - t0
    timings.append(cpu_time)
!ec

In Python, functions are ordinary objects so making a list of
functions is no more special than making a list of strings or numbers.

We can now iterate over `timings` and `functions` simultaneously via `zip`
to make a nice printout of the results:

!bc pycod
for cpu_time, function in zip(timings, functions):
    print '{f:<9s}: {cpu:.2f} s'.format(
        f=function.func_name, cpu=cpu_time)
!ec

Timings on a MacBook Air 11 running Ubuntu show that
the functions using `list.append` require almost the double of
the time of the functions that work with list comprehensions.
Even faster is the simple iteration over the string.
However, the built-in count functionality of strings
(`dna.count(base)`) runs over 30 times faster than the best of our
handwritten Python functions!
The reason is that the `for` loop needed to count in `dna.count(base)`
is actually implemented in C and runs very much faster than loops in Python.

A clear lesson learned is: google around before you start out to implement
what seems to be a quite common task. Others have probably already
done it for you, and most likely is their solution much better than what
you can (easily) come up with.

===== Verifying the implementations =====
label{bioinf:count:verify}

idx{test function}
idx{`nose` package}
idx{`test_*()` function}
idx{`assert` statement}

We end this section with showing how to make tests that verify our 12
counting functions. To this end, we make a new function that first
computes a certainly correct answer to a counting problem and then
calls all the `count_*` functions, stored in the list `functions`, to
check that each call has the correct result:

!bc pycod
def test_count_all():
    dna = 'ATTTGCGGTCCAAA'
    exact = dna.count('A')
    for f in functions:
        if f(dna, 'A') != exact:
            print f.__name__, 'failed'
!ec
Here, we believe in `dna.count('A')` as the correct answer.

We might take this test function one step further and adopt the
conventions in the "nose": "https://nose.readthedocs.org"
testing framework for Python code.
% if PRIMER_BOOK:
(See Section ref{sec:nose} for more information about nose.)
% endif

These conventions say that the test function should

 * have a name starting with `test_`;
 * have no arguments;
 * let a boolean variable, say `success`, be `True` if a test
   passes and be `False` if the test fails;
 * create a message about what failed, stored in some string, say `msg`;
 * use the construction `assert success, msg`, which will
   abort the program and write out the error message
   `msg` if `success` is `False`.

idx{`f.__name__` (name of func. `f`)}

The nose test framework can search for all Python files in a folder
tree, run all `test_*()` functions, and report how many of the
tests that failed, if we adopt the conventions above.
Our revised test function becomes

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def test_count_all@if __name__
It is worth notifying that the name of a function `f`, as a string object,
is given by `f.__name__`, and we make use of this information to
construct an informative message in case a test fails.

It is a good habit to write such test functions since the execution
of all tests in all files can be fully automated. Every time you to
a change in some file you can with minimum effort rerun all tests.

The entire suite of functions presented above, including the timings and tests,
can be found in the file "`count.py`": "${src_path}/count.py".
